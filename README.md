# Basin Node

In order to have VSCode correctly recognize Go dependencies, you might have to open the workspace with ./src as the root (or whatever folder has main.go).

## Getting started

Clone the `basin-node` repo:
```
git@github.com:sestinj/basin-node.git
```

Enter the `src` directory:
```
cd src
```

Start the application to find out what you can do:
```
go run main.go --help
```
