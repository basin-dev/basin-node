# Functions needed for register and modify commands

# Idea #1
# Use same methods for register and modify CLI commands?
# If URL does not exist, then create the Basin resource
# If URL does exist, then update with new JSON file
# For now, you won't be able to remove Basin URLs
# You will only be able to null its metadata

func SetWalletInfo(wallet WalletInfoJson)
 
func SetPermissions(dataUrl string, permissions PermissionJson)

func SetSchema(dataURL string, schema SchemaJson)

func SetSource(dataURL string)

func SetRequest(dataURL string, permissions PermissionJson)

# Idea #2
# But pausing this for a moment...
# So many open questions...
# UX of CLI for Idea #1 is terrible
# e.g. You need to edit JSON files and then pass them around?
# In that case, for v1, should we just have a CLI command for grabbing the latest
# metadata files from the node, which will just be added to a directory
# And then if people want to modify them, they can edit the files
# If they want to add new Basin resources, they can just add JSON files
# This seems better than this command based approach

# e.g. the commands would be...
# `basin-node metadata pull` (or we could just have the leveldb always write updates to files)
# `basin-node metadata push` (or we could just have the leveldb always read changes to files)
# and then the directory structure would be like
# Metadata
